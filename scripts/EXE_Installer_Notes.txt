EXE Installer Option (Windows built-in)

If you want a single-click EXE instead of BAT/PS1, you can wrap the installer using Windows IExpress:

1) Open Command Prompt in this folder.
2) Run:
   iexpress /N build_installer_iexpress.sed
3) This produces:
   CertifyIntel_Installer.exe

Notes:
- EXE is just a wrapper for the same BAT/PS1 flow.
- Excel Trust Center setting is still required for programmatic VBA import.
